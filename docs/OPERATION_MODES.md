## Global Keys and Navigations

- `R/T/B/S/Q/F/D/C`: toggle target mode; pressing same mode key again returns to `RX`.
- `M/N/O`: jump to MENU pages 1/2/3; pressing the same page key again on that page returns to `RX`.
- `` ` `` (ESC/backtick): global TX cancel in `RX`, `TX`, and `STATUS` when not editing.
- `▲` `▼` page up/down (RX/TX/BAND/MENU/QSO/Fetch/Delete).
- `◀` `▶` left/rigth (QSO-SNR/Status-Date-Time/MENU-Fixed-LongEdit)
- `1..6` always target the currently visible row/slot for the active mode.

## BLE Terminal
- `u` `v` page up/down (RX/TX/BAND/MENU/QSO/Fetch/Delete).
- `z` `x` left/rigth (QSO-SNR)

## BLE screen Layout

1. Text waterfall frame:
   ```text
   =============================  (29 `=` chars)
   [                           ]  (27 bins inside brackets)
   -----------------------------  (29 `-` chars) ```
4. Line 7 meta/edit line:
   - normal: `[MODE uv]` (`u`/`v` show page-up/page-down availability; `-` means not available)
   - text edit mode: `[Edit <item>]` (edit on BLE terminal, enter to send, no escape)

Notes:
- Waterfall bins use `space`, `.`, `:`, `|` each symbol indicates signal strength for about 100Hz
- counter: `|(slot boundary)`, `4`, `8`, `12`, `:(even)`, `.(odd)`, `o(Tx indicator)`
- decoded message count: `[D:n]`

## Per-Mode Controls
 - Long Edit(for freetext, comment and IgnoreList): Enter save, Backspace delete, `` ` `` cancel, `◀` `▶` move cursor
 - Edit (in place): Enter save, Backspace delete, `` ` `` cancel
